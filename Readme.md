## Particles

This project contains vanilla netbeans project and maven project. The source code and the unit tests are copied with symbolic links into three places; the project folders and the root folder.
I haven't removed the second project folder yet, because I am not sure which build system I like more.

The original source code is in folder Particles\_maven/src/main/java/org/tiralab/particles/.
