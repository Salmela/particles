/**
 * The package for models.
 *<p>
 * The models are classes that initialises and updates a list of
 * particles. These particles are then given to Storage object. You
 * can find the storage classes from the storages package.
 *<p>
 * These models are not very well tested, because they are only
 * used for testing the actual data structures. And they weren't the
 * main scope of this project.
